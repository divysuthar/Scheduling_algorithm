# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various CPU scheduling algorithms using Python. Each algorithm is implemented as a separate function, and the scheduling behavior is visualized using a Gantt chart generated by Matplotlib.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
2. **Priority Scheduling**
3. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
4. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/divysuthar/Scheduling_algorithm.git
    cd Scheduling_algorithm
    ```

## Usage

You can run each scheduling algorithm independently by executing the corresponding Python script.

```bash
python fcfs.py
python priority_scheduling.py
python sjf.py
